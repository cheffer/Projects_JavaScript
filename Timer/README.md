# Tests

- Tested in three browsers, Chrome, Edge, Firefox
  - For Firefox, the styling was a little deformed, but the functionalities were perfect, as well as in the other tested browsers
    - The focus wasn't styling with css, but training the functions with JavaScript, so I chose for the moment to leave the styling to Firefox like this
    - In future updates I will be fixing Firefox styling
