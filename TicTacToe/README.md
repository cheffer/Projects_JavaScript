# Projects TicTocToe

This is a project of a Tic Tac Toe game (known in Brazil as "jogo da velha").

# Description

I believe that many people already know how the game works, but if you don't, don't worry, I'll explain.

## Game

- To play this game, you need two players. One player uses "X" and the other player uses "O"
- Once from each, they fill the board, until one wins or draws.
- Whoever makes a sequence of 3 wins, being horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
	- Totaling 8 chances to win
	- 3 horizontal, 3 vertical and 2 diagonal
- if it fills the entire board and no player managed to close the sequence of 3, it is considered a draw.


In the game, I put the score of each player, and the tie.
It is also possible to change the color of the players.

If you want to continue playing to see who scores the most points, you have the new game button.
If you want to start from scratch with another player, there is a reset button that clears the points history
